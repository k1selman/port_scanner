# Port Scanner written in C++

**Libraries used:** iostream, sstream, string, vector, SFML/Network.hpp

If any compile errors occur, make sure you have environment variables and libraries set right.

**Idea:**
Keep it simple. 
Input address and port(or ports, for example 20-80, that is from 20 to 80) and wait for the scanning results.

**In order to run it one will have to:**

**1.** Compile the source code

**2.** Run the executable file and input required data
